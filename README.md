# azure_SIEM
I setup Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine acting as a honey pot. We will observe live attacks (RDP Brute Force) from all around the world. We will use a custom PowerShell script to look up the attackers Geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map!
